# EthStorage-Ceremony-Node-Run-Full-Guide
EthStorage is a modular, decentralized Layer 2 storage solution built on Ethereum, designed to provide programmable, key-value storage powered by Data Availability (DA). It aims to offer long-term DA solutions for rollups and enable fully on-chain applications like games, social networks, and AI. By leveraging Ethereum’s security and EIP-4844 (data blobs), EthStorage addresses the challenge of temporary blob data availability, ensuring L2s can sync their state from L1 or other DA layers. It incentivizes storage providers with ETH fees and ensures high replication for data integrity. The project raised $7M at a $100M valuation, with backing from partners like Galxe and support from the Ethereum Foundation for DA research.

Recently, EthStorage launched its V1 Trusted Setup Ceremony (Aug 13–22, 2025), a key milestone to generate secure zk-SNARK parameters for its proof-of-storage algorithm, enhancing transparency and decentralization. Contributors with a GitHub account (at least one month old, one public repo, five followings, and one follower) can participate using a Linux, MacOS, or WSL system with a stable internet connection.

## Key Features
- Decentralized Layer 2 Storage: Provides scalable, programmable key-value storage on Ethereum for rollups and on-chain apps like games, social networks, and AI.
- Long-Term Data Availability (DA): Leverages Ethereum’s security and EIP-4844 data blobs to ensure persistent DA for Layer 2 solutions.
- High Data Replication: Ensures data integrity through extensive replication across storage providers, incentivized by ETH fees.
- zk-SNARK Proof-of-Storage: Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs for secure, transparent storage verification, with a V1 Trusted Setup Ceremony (Aug 13–22, 2025) to generate parameters.
